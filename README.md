# NYC-Property-Tax-Record-Fraud-Detection-Unsupervised-Learning

# Introduction

This presents an unsupervised machine learning challenge, wherein the objective is to detect anomalies within the NYC Property Valuation dataset, specifically focusing on individuals engaged in improper property tax filing practices. To address this task, we employed techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Z-score analysis, and Autoencoder models. Prior to applying these methods, the dataset underwent thorough preprocessing, including handling missing values and performing feature engineering.
